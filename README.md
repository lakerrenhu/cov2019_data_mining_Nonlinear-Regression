use nonlinear regression to predict the number of infected cases based on Cov19 Florida data
Nonlinear methods are applied to fit the trends of daily number and total number of infected cases. The simulation results show: (1) for the trends of daily number of infected cases versus day, both methods used in this project fit the model well while the modified quadratic Michaellis-Menten (MM) method slightly outperforms another method indicated by MSE; (2) for the trends of total number of infected cases versus day, the quadratic MM model works better than Poisson model.
